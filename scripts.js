//Step 1 - Declare a character variable in your code.
//Step 2 - Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.
//Step 3 - Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.
let character = 'Hello';

//Step 4 - Print the value of the character variable to the console. 
//Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.

console.log(character);

//Step 5 - After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.

character = "World";

//Step 6 - Now log your character variable to the console again.

console.log(character);

//Step 7 - Use camel case to declare a new secondCharacter variable.

let secondCharacter;

/*Step 9 - Assign the string "Test" to your secondCharacter variable below your declaration. 
Open the console to see how your log has changed.

secondCharacter = "Test"; */

secondCharacter = character;

//Step 8 - Add a console.log() to see what the value of your secondCharacter variable is.

console.log(secondCharacter);
