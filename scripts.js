//Step 1 - Declare a character variable in your code.
//Step 2 - Initialize your character variable by assigning it the value "Hello" during its declaration.
//Step 3 - Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.
let character = 'Hello';

//Step 4 - Print the value of the character variable to the console. 
//Then, click the "Console" button to view the JavaScript console.



//Step 5 - After your console.log, assign the value "World" to your character variable.



//Step 6 - Now log your character variable to the console again.



//Step 7 - Use camel case to declare a new secondCharacter variable.



/*Step 9 - Assign the string "Test" to your secondCharacter variable below your declaration. 
Open the console to see how your log has changed.

secondCharacter = "Test"; */



//Step 8 - Add a console.log() to see what the value of your secondCharacter variable is.


//Step 12 - Use let to declare a count variable.
let count = 8;

//Step 13 - Try printing count + 1 to the console.

//console.log(count+1);

//Step 14 - When you are ready to move on, remove the console.log.

//Step 15 - Declare a rows variable and assign it an empty array.
// let rows = [];


//Step 16 - Change your rows declaration to be an array with the strings "Naomi", "Quincy", and "CamperChan".

let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy","CamperChan"];

//Step 17 - Use console.log and bracket notation to print the first value in your rows array.

//Step 25
rows.push("freeCodeCamp");

let popped = rows.pop();
console.log(popped);

console.log(rows);
